1. add support for ".git" ,the HL is handeld by (ShellScript) if u have a better option plz msg me.

** if u use (https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Dotfiles%20Syntax%20Highlighting) ,remove the '.git & dockerfile' extensions from the (Shell-Unix-Generic.sublime-settings) so the new icon can show-up.
