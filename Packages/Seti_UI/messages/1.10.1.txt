v1.10.1 (11-11-2014)
-------------------

1.
ColdFusion support added.

2.
i added another icon for the Opened_folder in-case the default one was too distractive for you ,
you can use either the default or the new ones ,just go to
(Seti_UI/+res/Open_Folder/dots) , copy the new files and overwrite the old ones @ (Seti_UI/icons)

2.1.
if you want to remove the Opened_folder icon all together ,
there is a modified "Seti.sublime-theme" at the same folder (+res/Open_Folder/)
just overwrite the installed file on the root with this one. (it have everything except the Opened_folder icons)
