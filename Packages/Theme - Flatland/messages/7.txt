-------------------

1. BIG FAT thanx to lefoy (https://github.com/lefoy/cyanide-theme) & Centril (https://github.com/Centril),
	pretty much all the icons now works, so make sure to show'em some love.

** some of the new icons are borrowed from their work + making/changing some other. "some icons may get changed later"

2. no more need for the packages i made for "Less/Sass/SCSS" as now the included lang files fix that and does exactly what i was trying to do in the first place,
	so u can install any of those packages from their original authors just like normal and everything will be working just fine.

3. the new update doesn't require any special configuration, but u will notice that there is an extra panel of "Seti_UI"
	with some languages in the language selector panel, you don't need to worry about it, rather simply ignore it..

4. more file-types added to test with.

5. some icons has gained/lost some weight.
