-------------------

1. add options for different "line_padding" so u r free to use the default '0' and still get the same experience.
* if u use "0" don't add any of the new "Seti_pad_?" to ur settings.
* the new options affect (quick_panel, search_panel, gutter_fold_icons, auto_complete_panel.
* search_panel after setting new options needs to be dragged_up & down to fix its size. (its related to ST not the theme it self)
 
2. for Retina Macs with fold icons wasn't showing ,now its fixed.
3. readme / install updated.
4. finally found how to make the search panel slimmer (ITS A NEW DAWN).



*** try this
{
	"line_padding_bottom": 0,
	"line_padding_top": 0,
	"caret_extra_bottom": 7,
	"caret_extra_top": 7,
}
